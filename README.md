presents the design, development, and evaluation of a Travel Record Management System created for a specialist travel agency. 
The application manages three categories of records: Client Records, Airline Company Records, and Flight Records. 
The system was built using Python, adopting a modular architecture and implementing a Tkinter-based Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
Records are stored persistently using JSON files and maintained internally as lists of dictionaries. 
The system supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, ensuring users can efficiently manage travel-related data.
